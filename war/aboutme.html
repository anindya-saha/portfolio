			<label class="sectionheading">Me...</label>
			<p>A cheerful, honest and a sincere individual... take life as it
			comes, enjoy it's moments and stay positive...humorous and
			witty...which is what my friends tell me...try my best to be honest at
			most of the times...that's me in a nutshell!!</p>
			
			<label class="sectionheading">Junior school years...</label>
			<p>My schooling was from <a href="http://www.sxipanihati.org/">St.
			Xavier's Institution, Sodepur</a>. I still remember the first day of my
			school when I sat in the class with my back towards the blackboard and
			me facing towards the end of the class. Fortunately, a kind little kid
			corrected me... who eventualy became my best friend. I made a mess on
			the first day of school... but that was it... from then onwards there
			was no looking back!!!</p>
			
			<label class="sectionheading">Graduation...</label>
			<p>I studied in the 2nd best engineering college in the state, <a
				href="http://www.becs.ac.in/">Bengal Engineering &amp; Science
			University, Shibpur</a>. I managed to score in the top 1% to secure a
			place there. I graduated in Electrical Engineering (B.E.) in 2002. If
			you are a fan of Bryan Adams and heard Summer of '69 then I can
			describe my tenure at university in his words, "those were the best
			days of my life". 4 years at the hostels, staying awake late night for
			assignments, labs till 7 in the evening, studying hard when exams were
			knocking at the door... otherwise fooling around with roommates &
			friends and having lots of fun... are just unforgettable memories. I
			was fortunate to have some awesome roommates... one was fundoo... one
			was always afraid... one was always forgetful...we were and are still
			friends.</p>
			
			<label class="sectionheading">Post Graduation...</label>
			<p>I am studying Master of Science in Computer Science @Texas A &amp; M University, College Station, Texas, USA. 
			I have joined TAMU in Fall 2014 and expect to graduate by Fall 2016.<br/>
			I have also completed an executive program in Global Business Management from Indian Institute of Management,  Calcutta.</p>
			
			<label class="sectionheading">Career...</label>
			<p>My career started with <a
			href="http://www.tcs.com/homepage/Pages/default.aspx">Tata
			Consultancy Services (TCS)</a>. I was selected during my 3rd year at
			campus recruitments. After 7 ½ years in TCS I moved to <a
				href="http://www.ibm.com/in/en/">IBM
			</a> and been for 1 ½ years there. After that I moved to 
			<a href="http://www.cognizant.com/">Cognizant 
			Technology Solutions (CTS)</a>. Well... I met some of my best
			colleagues and closest friends during my career... full of fun and
			enthusiam... enjoyed working together on challenging projects and at
			the same time had immense fun... rarely tensed even in the midst of
			tough situations, deadlines...which earned me the title of "chillax"
			from my buddies. I learnt one thing from my experience, if we really
			enjoy what we do, it never seems to be work anymore...its passion.</p>

		<p>Ours is a sweet happy family of five...me, my wife, my brother and my
		parents. My parents are really humble and down to earth; traditional
		but not conservative. My father is a self made man, started from
		scratch and an established business man now. He runs his own factory
		for 35 years now. My mother is a doting homemaker and spoiling us with
		her love and care like all moms do. My brother completed his M.Tech
		in Computer Science from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur and now working with Microsoft. My wife 
		is doing her MBA from IISWBM, Calcutta and also working as an HR in BAPL, Calcutta.
		My mom is a religious lady and by virtue of her we get to have lots of pujas and 
		rituals round the year... which gives a chance for get togethers too.</p>
