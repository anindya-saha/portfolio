		<p>Inspite of workloads I do religiously take out time in
		implementing Data Structures and Algorithms to solutions of
		interesting problems. I follow <a href="http://www.spoj.pl/"
			target="_blank">SPOJ</a> and <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc"
			target="_blank">Topcoder</a>. SPOJ has over 1200 problems and an
		ideal platform to sharpen one's understanding of algorithms and their
		application to problem solving. I work on these problems in my
		leisure.I have accumulated some of solutions given in the link below.
		I have listed these solutions for my own reference in future and for
		others to check out. I hope that going through these interesting
		problems would intrigue the readers and encourage them to participate
		in these competitive sites.
		<p><a href="SPOJ_Solved_Problems_Anindya.pdf" target="_blank">Algorithms
		and their applications>></a></p>
		<label class="sectionheading">Technical:</label>
		<p>I am focusing on to specialize in Software Architecting, SOA
		and Performance Modeling and Optimization. Mature into an all-round
		solution architect developing and contributing to state-of-the-art
		software frameworks for the IT industry.</p>
		<p>My major areas of specialization includes J2EE, EJB 3.0, Web
		services and Cloud Computing. I have started working out my way
		through the vast field of WebServices and Cloud Computing. As you know
		that working in a service oriented industry offers little scope to
		involve in these domains and experimentation -- but I am trying really
		hard.</p>
		<p>I enjoy architecting scalable, reliable and robust multithread
		distributed/clustered frameworks. Also work extensively on JVM tuning,
		Debuggers, JVM Profilers and implement innovative caching mehodologies
		and algorithms to minimise memory footprints on the server.</p>
		<label class="sectionheading">Rich UI Apps:</label>
		<p>I have an inclination towards creative arts which is also the
		reason I also take interest in Rich Internet Application based on Flex
		and JavaFx&reg;. I have myself made a few e-magazines based on
		FlashMX. When I am not working I learn JavaFx&reg;, Adobe&reg;
		Flex&reg; and Adobe&reg; Photoshop&reg;. We publish an e-magazine
		every year on the eve of Durga Puja (the biggest festival in our
		state); I take the ownership of designing and developing the
		Adobe&reg; Flash&reg; based e-magazine.</p>

		Ray</a>, whose movies offerred a realistic portrayal of the urban as well
