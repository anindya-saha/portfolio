			I am studying Master of Science in Computer Science @Texas A &amp; M University, College Station, Texas, USA. I have joined TAMU in Fall 2014 and expect to graduate by Fall 2016.
			Before leaving job and going back to academics I was working as a Technology Architect @Cognizant Technology Solutions US Corp. I have worked for almost 12+ years as an IT professional and decided to return to academics to do research and strengthen some of my concepts through academic rigour.
		</p>
		<p>
			My interest areas include Software Architecting, SOA and Performance Modeling and Optimization. My academic interests
			are Big Data and Data Mining. I am also working on clearing up the cloud on what cloud computing is and learn hadoop.
		</p>
		<p>
			I see myself to mature into an all-round solution architect 
			developing and contributing to state-of-the-art software frameworks for the software industry.
