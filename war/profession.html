		<p>I have an experience of 11 years as a Software engineer,
		Consultant and presently a Technology Architect in the IT industry. I have
		had a very dynamic work profile and have been associated with
		multifarious technical and functional responsibilities. I had gained
		considerable international exposures through on-job deputation and
		working with global clients. My two biggest international project
		implementations have been @Minneapolis, USA and @Peterborough, UK.
		Apart from that there had been also a few more in India.</p>
		<p>I started my career with <a
			href="http://www.tcs.com/homepage/Pages/default.aspx">Tata
		Consultancy Services (TCS)</a>. TCS is the largest software exporter and
		IT service company in India. It is ranked 2nd in the overall rankings
		of the 'most admired companies in India' in the <a
			href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125017981772929505.html"
			style="color: #FFF">Asia 2009 survey of The Wall Street Journal</a>.
		I worked at TCS for 7½ years.</p>
		<p>After an enriching experience in TCS, I moved on to <a
			href="http://www.ibm.com/in/en/">IBM</a>. IBM is one of the largest manufactures of software services,
		hardware, middleware, software products etc. I worked for the Global
		Business Services wing based in Kolkata, India. IBM is presently <a
			href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2012/full_list/index.html"
			style="color: #FFF"> ranked 19 in Fortune 500 ranking, 2012</a>.</p>
		<p>After a well round exposure to latest sofware and architecting trends 
		at IBM for 1½ years, I moved on to <a
			href="http://www.cognizant.com/">Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTS)</a>. 
		Cognizant is again another Fortune 500 mnc and one of the global giants in 
		Information Technology arena. I work for the BPM Technology Consulting Group (TCG) 
		@Kolkata, India. CTS is presently <a
			href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2012/full_list/301_400.html"
			style="color: #FFF"> ranked 398 in Fortune 500 ranking, 2012</a>.</p>
		<p>I was recruited on-campus by TCS. I started my career in July,
		2002 as an Assistant System Engineer(Trainee). I have then moved on to
		Developer, Designer, Functional &amp; Technical Analyst, Module
		Leader, Associate Architect and now a Technology Architect. I enjoy 
		technically challeging projects and integrating disparate
		Enterprise applications.</p>
